# UI Test Plan — Atlas

Run with: `test/ui-test.sh` (from the repo root).

Each case has these files under `test/cases/`:

- `<name>.in` — commands fed to Atlas (must end with `bye`)
- `<name>.expected` — lines that must appear in the output (substring match,
  mirroring the course grading scripts; tolerant of bubble formatting).
  Indexed list lines (e.g. `1.[T][ ] task`, `1.[C] Bob`) only occur in listing
  output (`list`, `find`, `client list`, `client find`), so they prove stored
  state rather than acknowledgement text.
- `<name>.in2` (optional) — a second session run in the same working
  directory after the first, used to test persistence across restarts.
  Expected substrings cover both runs' combined output.

Each case runs in its own temporary working directory, so Level-7 data files
are isolated and every case starts with a fresh task list.

## Level-8 note

Deadline `/by` values are dates since Level-8: input `yyyy-mm-dd`, output
`MMM dd yyyy`. Non-date values are rejected with the Fates message. The data
file stores the ISO date (e.g. `D | 0 | x | 2019-10-15`); old files with
non-date `by` values are skipped as corrupted on load.

## A-Varargs note

Since A-Varargs, `find` takes any number of whitespace-separated keywords
(e.g. `find book paper`). A task matches when its description contains ANY
of the keywords (case-sensitive OR), in insertion order. Bare `find` still
shows the missing-keyword message.

## D-Clients note

The `client` command manages client records alongside tasks:

- `client add <name> [/phone <number>] [/email <address>]` — name required,
  the two markers optional and accepted in either order
- `client list` — every client, numbered from 1
- `client find <keyword> [<keyword> ...]` — a client matches when its NAME,
  phone or email contains the keyword (case-sensitive OR), in insertion order
- `client delete <number>` — removes one client

Clients and tasks are numbered independently, so deleting a client never
renumbers tasks and vice versa. `list` shows tasks only and `client list`
shows clients only.

Both entity types live in the same data file, distinguished by the first
field: `T`, `D` and `E` are tasks, `C` is a client. A client record is written
as `C | name | phone | email`, with empty phone and email fields when they are
not known; on load, 2 to 4 fields are accepted so a hand-written file without
the optional fields still loads. Records are written tasks first, then
clients. Delimiters inside any field are escaped as `\|` and `\\`, exactly as
for tasks. Unknown record types and malformed client records are skipped as
corrupted lines, keeping the rest of the file.

Unit tests cover the client list operations, the display form, the matching
rule, and the storage round trip, including hand-written records that hold
only a name, or a name and a phone.

Intentional behaviour change introduced with this increment: the unknown-word
reply now lists `client` among the commands. Two cases produce that reply.
`unknown-command.expected` asserts the full line, so it was updated in the
same commit. `uppercase-bye.expected` asserts only the opening words of the
message, so it needed no change; it now also asserts the `list` reply that
follows, which is what proves the session continues after an unknown word.

| `empty-values` | whitespace-only descriptions and empty date fields rejected | `todo  `, `deadline task /by `, `event party /from  /to end`, `event party /from start /to `, `list`, `bye` | All four full error messages; list still empty |
| `delete-case` | delete removes the task and renumbers | `todo a`, `deadline b /by 2019-12-02`, `event c /from 1pm /to 2pm`, `delete 2`, `list`, `delete 1`, `list`, `bye` | Removed task shown `[D][ ] b (by: Dec 02 2019)`; count drops; list renumbers without gaps |
| `delete-bad` | delete with non-number, zero, out-of-range, or no index | `delete abc`, `delete 0`, `delete 99`, `delete`, `bye` | Full pantheon message; bare-command prompt |
| `delete-only` | deleting the last task empties the list cleanly | `todo only`, `delete 1`, `list`, `bye` | Removed shown; `Now you have 0 tasks in the list.`; `Your list is empty.` |
| `find-case` | Level-9: find tasks by a case-sensitive description keyword | add two tasks containing `book`, add an unrelated task, `find book`, `find missing`, bare `find` | Matching tasks are listed in insertion order; no-match and missing-keyword messages are shown |
| `find-multi-keyword` | A-Varargs: find accepts several whitespace-separated keywords; any keyword matches (OR) | `todo read book`, `deadline return book /by 2019-10-15`, `todo visit museum`, `find book paper`, `find missing`, `find museum`, bare `find`, `bye` | Both `book` rows listed in order for `book paper`; no-match message; `museum` row listed alone; missing-keyword message |
| `state-recovery` | errors leave the list untouched; mark/delete after errors work | `todo keep`, `deadline due /by 2019-12-02`, `event meet /from 10am /to 11am`, `deadline broken`, `mark 99`, `delete 99`, `list`, `mark 2`, `delete 1`, `list`, `unmark 1`, `list`, `bye` | Errors do not add tasks; indexed snapshots prove keep removed, due stays marked through the delete, then unmarks |
| `large-list` | dynamic sizing and storage correctness beyond 100 tasks | 101 `todo task N` commands, `list`, `mark 101`, `delete 1`, `list`, `bye` | Indexed lines for tasks 1/100/101; 101st markable; after delete: renumbered, 101st still marked, count 100 |
| `level7-persistence` | Level-7: save on change, load on restart | run 1: add todo/deadline/event, `mark 2`, `list`, `bye`; run 2: `list`, `unmark 2`, `list`, `delete 1`, `list`, `bye` | Run 2 lists run 1's tasks loaded from disk with mark intact; unmark and delete persist and renumber |
| `level8-dates` | Level-8: deadline dates parse (yyyy-mm-dd) and print formatted (MMM dd yyyy); non-dates rejected | `deadline submit /by 2019-10-15`, `deadline newyear /by 2020-01-05`, `list`, `deadline bad /by 15/10/2019`, `list`, `bye` | Formatted lines `(by: Oct 15 2019)` and `(by: Jan 05 2020)`; full rejection message for `15/10/2019`; the two valid deadlines still listed |
| `client-add-list` | D-Clients: add clients with and without optional fields, then list them | `client add Bob`, `client add Mary Jane /phone 91234567`, `client add Chen Wei /email wei@example.com`, `client add Dara /phone 8123 4567 /email dara@example.com`, `client list`, `bye` | Echo of each added client; counts in singular and plural; indexed client lines showing phone and email only when known, and both together for a client that has both |
| `client-errors` | D-Clients: every malformed client command is rejected and adds nothing | `client`, `client foo`, `client add`, `client add /phone 91234567`, `client add Bob /phone`, `client add Bob /email`, `client add B /phone /email x@y.com` (two markers sharing one space), `client add A /email /phone 2`, `client delete`, `client delete abc`, `client delete 0`, `client delete 99`, `client find`, `client list`, `bye` | Full usage, missing-name, empty-value, missing-number, no-such-client and missing-keyword messages; client list still empty |

| `client-persistence` | D-Clients: clients and tasks share one file and survive a restart, including escaped delimiters | run 1: two `client add` commands (one with `|` and `\` in the fields), `todo buy milk`, `bye`; run 2: `client list`, `list`, `client delete 1`, `client list`, `bye` | Run 2 loads both entity types from disk; escaped characters round-trip; deleting a client keeps the task and renumbers the rest |

## Harness limitation

The harness only checks that each expected line is present; it cannot check
that an unwanted line is absent. A case therefore cannot, by itself, prove
that a rejected command left the stored state unchanged. Where that proof
matters, the case has to add a follow-up command whose reply differs when the
state is wrong (for example deleting the row that should not exist and
expecting the not-found message).

## Maintenance rule

After every code update: re-run `test/ui-test.sh`. If behaviour changed
intentionally, update this plan and the case files in the same commit as the
code change. If a case fails, fix the code first — the tests are the contract.
